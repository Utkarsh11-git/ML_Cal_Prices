# Analyzing the California House Price Dataset Using ML
The objective of this Data Science project is to understand the dataset containing information about California house prices. By conducting exploratory data analysis, we aim to uncover insights and relationships within the data and use ML algorithms such as Linear Regression and Random Forest for predicting the value of the dependent variable based on the values of independent variables.

### Objective
* **Data Exploration:**: Explore the dataset to understand its structure, missing values, and basic statistics.
* **Data Cleaning**: Preprocess the data by handling missing values, outliers, and formatting issues.
* **Feature Engineering**: Create new features or transform existing ones to enhance the predictive power of the model.
* **Descriptive Analysis**: Conduct exploratory data analysis to uncover patterns and relationships in the data.
* **Model Building**: Develop and train machine learning models based on the nature of the problem.
* **Evaluation and Validation**: Assess the performance of the models using appropriate metrics.
* **Interpretability and Explanation**: Provide insights into how the model makes predictions.
* **Visualizations**: Create visualizations (e.g., bar charts, histograms) to present findings effectively.

### Insights
* The average median age of residents on the island is the greatest, while that of residents in inland areas is the lowest.
* The majority of households are located on the coast.
* A positive correlation between the median income and the median house value, meaning that as income rises, so does the value of the home.
* Median house value has a positive correlation with <1H Ocean but has a negative correlation with Inland.
* Those who live near the ocean have a higher median income than those who do not.
* Linear Regression The model score is 0.66, whereas Random Forest Regression scored 0.81

### Tools and Libraries
* **Python** programming language.
* Libraries such as **Pandas**, **NumPy**, **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** and **Sklearn** for data manipulation and visualization.
* **Jupyter Notebook** in Visual Studio for documentation and analysis.
